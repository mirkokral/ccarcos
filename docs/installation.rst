Installation
===============


| To install arcos2, simply run ``wget run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mirkokral/ccarcos/main/inst.lua``.  
| The installer moves all files in the root directory to a temporary directory, located at /data/old.
| The (currently wip) OOBE program copies the old data to the user directory
