By using arcos, you automatically agree to these
terms. Agreement to this file is also required By
the stock arcos installer.
We (the arcos development team) may:
- Collect telemetry information.
Telemetry sample data:
For an error: 
    - Message: text must not be nil
    - File: /system/krnl.lua
    - Line: 2
For a kernel panic:
    - Debug: <all info from the whole stack of 
    debug.getinfo>
    - Message: Argument invalid
If there is no file at /temporary/telemetry, no 
telemetry has been collected and no telemetry will be
collected.
(every telemetry call checks for 
/temporary/telemetry, if it's not found it skips 
telemetry else it overrides it with the new
telemetry and sends the telemetry to the server)
Turning off telemetry:
To turn off telemetry, use gconfig or (if gconfig
doesn't have telemetry stuff) modify /config/aboot,
find the "telemetry" field and disable it
